# Post-Quantum Cryptography Naming and Formatting Standards

This document defines **mandatory naming and formatting standards** for post-quantum cryptographic algorithms, aligned with NIST standardization. These rules apply uniformly across **documentation, code comments, source code, and file naming**.

Consistency here is not optional—it is a governance requirement.
