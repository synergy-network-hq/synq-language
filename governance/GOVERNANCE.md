# SynQ Governance & Stewardship Statement

***SynQ*** is an open-source smart contract language and virtual machine developed to advance secure, deterministic, and post-quantum-ready decentralized computation. Its governance model is intentionally designed to balance openness, technical stewardship, and long-term ecosystem trust.

---

## Governance Philosophy

**SynQ** is governed under the principle of open implementation, stewarded standards.

- The source code is open to public inspection, contribution, and review.
- The standards, certification criteria, and trademark usage are stewarded to preserve correctness, security, and ecosystem coherence.
- No single entity may arbitrarily alter **SynQ’s** guarantees once contracts are deployed.

This model exists to prevent fragmentation, silent weakening of security guarantees, and incompatible “look-alike” implementations that undermine trust.

---

## **Roles and Responsibilities**

### Core Stewards

The **SynQ** Core Stewards are responsible for:

- Maintaining the reference implementation
- Reviewing and merging protocol-affecting changes
- Publishing canonical specifications
- Managing security disclosures
- Overseeing certification standards

Core Stewards act as custodians, not owners, of the protocol.

### Community Contributors

Community contributors may:

- Submit code, documentation, tooling, and research
- Propose language and VM improvements
- Participate in design discussions and audits

All contributions are reviewed for determinism, formal verifiability, and security impact.

---

## Change Management

**SynQ** follows a conservative evolution policy:

- Changes that affect determinism, cryptography, gas semantics, or verification rules require:
  - Public proposal
  - Security review
  - Backward-compatibility analysis

- Breaking changes are avoided wherever possible and clearly versioned when unavoidable.

This policy ensures deployed contracts retain their original guarantees.

---

## Security Stewardship

Security is treated as a first-class governance concern.

- Vulnerability disclosures follow a coordinated disclosure process
- Emergency mitigations are documented and auditable
- Formal verification is preferred over reactive patching

Security decisions prioritize correctness over convenience.

---

## Certification and Trust Signals

The **SynQ** name and certification marks (e.g., **SynQ** Certified) exist to communicate trust, not exclusivity.

Certification:

- Is optional but recommended for production deployments
- Indicates conformance to published **SynQ** standards
- Is granted through transparent audit criteria

Certification authority is stewarded to prevent dilution or misuse.

---

## Independence and Longevity

**SynQ** is designed to outlive any single organization, contributor, or market cycle.

- The protocol is not dependent on proprietary infrastructure
- The governance framework prioritizes long-term security over short-term incentives
- Open standards and cryptographic guarantees ensure survivability

---

## Closing Statement

**SynQ** exists to set a higher bar for smart contract safety in the quantum era.
Its governance reflects that responsibility.
