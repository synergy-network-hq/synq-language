# SynQ Example Contracts Security Audit Summary

Audit Campaign ID: `SYNQ-EXAMPLES-2026-02-09`
Audit Date: 2026-02-09
Auditing Entity: SynQ Internal Engineering Review
Scope: Six canonical example contracts in `/Users/devpup/Desktop/Synergy/synergy-components/synq-language/docs/examples`
Scope Commit Hash: `71aab8af592d6a1523679354a0a67db7106655d7`
Rust Toolchain: `rustc 1.91.0`, `cargo 1.91.0`

## Executive Summary

All six example contracts are **Not Certified**.

Historical note (2026-02-09): all six failed parser intake under the official CLI/compiler path.
Revalidation update (2026-02-15): parser/compile compatibility is now restored for all six contracts (see `EVIDENCE-COMPILE-CHECKS-2026-02-15.md`).

On top of the parser-level blocker, each contract contains material security design defects. The largest recurring class is cryptographic misuse: privileged paths verify ML-DSA signatures over an externally supplied `messageToSign` blob without contract-side message construction, domain separation, or nonce/anti-replay state. In plain terms, this is authorization theater; a valid signature can be replayed or repurposed unless the contract itself binds intent.

Bottom line: parser compatibility has improved, but these six files are still not production candidates because Critical/High security findings remain unresolved.

## Scope and Evidence

### In-Scope Contracts

1. `/Users/devpup/Desktop/Synergy/synergy-components/synq-language/docs/examples/1-ERC20-Token.synq`
2. `/Users/devpup/Desktop/Synergy/synergy-components/synq-language/docs/examples/2-MultiSig-Wallet.synq`
3. `/Users/devpup/Desktop/Synergy/synergy-components/synq-language/docs/examples/3-DAO-Voting.synq`
4. `/Users/devpup/Desktop/Synergy/synergy-components/synq-language/docs/examples/4-NFT-Contract.synq`
5. `/Users/devpup/Desktop/Synergy/synergy-components/synq-language/docs/examples/5-Escrow-Contract.synq`
6. `/Users/devpup/Desktop/Synergy/synergy-components/synq-language/docs/examples/6-Staking-Contract.synq`

### Automated Evidence Commands

- `cargo run -p cli -- compile --path docs/examples/1-ERC20-Token.synq`
- `cargo run -p cli -- compile --path docs/examples/2-MultiSig-Wallet.synq`
- `cargo run -p cli -- compile --path docs/examples/3-DAO-Voting.synq`
- `cargo run -p cli -- compile --path docs/examples/4-NFT-Contract.synq`
- `cargo run -p cli -- compile --path docs/examples/5-Escrow-Contract.synq`
- `cargo run -p cli -- compile --path docs/examples/6-Staking-Contract.synq`

Observed result (2026-02-09): parser failure with `expected contract_part` at first contract member declaration.  
Observed result (2026-02-15 revalidation): all six compile successfully and emit both `.compiled.synq` and `.sol` artifacts.

## Cross-Contract Finding Matrix

| Finding Theme | Severity | Contracts Affected | Why It Matters |
|---|---|---|---|
| Official parser/CLI compile failure | High (Closed 2026-02-15) | 0/6 current | Previously blocked execution/certification; now resolved via parser compatibility updates |
| Signature intent not bound in contract state machine | Critical | 6/6 | Enables replay and signature context confusion |
| Missing explicit anti-replay nonce/counter storage | Critical | 6/6 | Privileged operations can be replayed |
| Incomplete/placeholder execution logic | High | 4/6 | Business-critical state transitions do not map to real asset movement |
| Access-control invariants incomplete | High | 4/6 | Threshold/governance controls can be bypassed or degraded |

## Certification Decision

- ERC20 Example: Not Certified
- MultiSig Example: Not Certified
- DAO Example: Not Certified
- NFT Example: Not Certified
- Escrow Example: Not Certified
- Staking Example: Not Certified

Campaign Decision: **Fail**

Rationale: unresolved High/Critical findings in every scope item (compile blocker closed, security blockers still open).

## Immediate Program-Level Actions (Required)

1. Freeze the current six examples as `NON-PRODUCTION` and remove any production-ready claims in `/Users/devpup/Desktop/Synergy/synergy-components/synq-language/docs/Examples-Index.md`.
2. Define a canonical SynQ contract syntax profile and either:
   - migrate examples to that profile, or
   - expand parser/codegen to accept the existing style.
3. Introduce a mandatory authorization helper pattern for all PQC-gated functions:
   - deterministic payload assembly in-contract
   - domain separator (`contract`, `chain`, `function`, `version`)
   - per-signer nonce monotonicity check
4. Add CI gate that compiles every contract under `/Users/devpup/Desktop/Synergy/synergy-components/synq-language/docs/examples`.
5. Add negative tests proving replay resistance on each governance/admin path.
